	<div id="quotes">
		<p>“When a man gives his opinion, he's a man. When a woman gives her opinion, she's a bitch.” - Bette Davis</p>
		<p>“Why do people say "grow some balls"? Balls are weak and sensitive. If you wanna be tough, grow a vagina. Those things can take a pounding.”-Sheng Wang</p>
		<p>“A feminist is anyone who recognizes the equality and full humanity of women and men.”-Gloria Steinem</p>
